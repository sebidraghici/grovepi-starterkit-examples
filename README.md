# grovepi-starterkit-examples
I will be going through the starter kits examples here.

I get a 403 when trying to download the actual code from/for the manuel from their github so I am reproducing it here. All rights and liscenses belong to Dexter Industries.

Code location: https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi/blob/master/Software/Python/

Although it might very, since I will be playing with it.
